# Hitachi Energy Recruitment Task - Cat Facts WebApp

## Description
This project is a **Cat Facts WebApp** designed to showcase both front-end and back-end development skills. The application fetches random cat facts from public APIs and presents them in a responsive web interface. The back-end service retrieves cat facts and associates them with random users, providing a seamless experience through **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.

## How to Run
1. Ensure that **Java 17** and **npm** are installed on your system.
2. Open a Bash terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Bash script with the following command:

```bash
./start_app.sh
```

Make sure the server is running on port 8080 and the client on port 5173. Finally, open your browser and go to the front-end URL to access the application.

## Conclusion
This project was a great learning experience! I built the application using **Spring Boot** (Java) for the back-end and **React** (JavaScript)
for the front-end, alongside **JUnit** and **Mockito** for testing. I chose these tools because I hadn't previously worked with **TypeScript** or **Kotlin**, but I am eager to learn them in the future. 

Working on this app taught me a lot about **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** and **RxJS**. Iâ€™d be more than happy to discuss the development process, explain my design choices, and share why I approached certain challenges the way I did.
